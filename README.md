# racket-turnbasedbattle
Heavily WIP attempt to create a Dragon Warrior NES clone.

Plan on implementing an overworld/gui using ncurses, but for now just focusing on getting the battle system working.

Could serve as a (naive) example of using the state monad in Racket for passing around a random-number generator?

Comments/advice/criticism very much appreciated :)
